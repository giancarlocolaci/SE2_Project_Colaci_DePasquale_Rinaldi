Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Description of the given problem 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will project and implement PowerEnjoy, which is a new car-sharing service
 that exclusively employs electric cars.
 The system that will be developed has to allow the registration of a new
 user with all his personal information (like name, age, driving license
 and credit card information), log in credentials and the possibility to
 find the locations of available cars within a certain distance from his
 current location or from a specified address.
 Moreover, according to some policies (specified later) the user can obtain
 exclusive discounts and offers.

\begin_layout Itemize
log into the system;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
find the location of available cars in a specified area;

\begin_layout Subsection
Stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our primary stakeholder is the professor who gave us this didactical project.
 Our stakeholder's main need is to review the complete project at the end
 of the semester.
 Our objective is to show him/her we have followed the development process
 in all its parts and that we are able to carry out a challenging task from
 the beginning to the end fully comprehending all its internal phases.
 We want to show that we can identify key requirements and specifications,
 design and test our web/mobile application while providing all documentation
 backing up the source code.
 Finally, our typical users will be people that don’t have a car or that
 prefer to rent a car instead of a public service transportation to go around
 the city.

Overall Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proposed System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server-side implementation will be structured through a net of micro-service
s mainly written in Python and managed through Docker.
 The server will run the business logic, host PowerEnjoy's website, and
 users' data.
 Besides, we propose a web/mobile application which allows to registered
 users to use PowerEnjoy's services.
 The web client will use Python/Javascript and HTML5/CSS for web pages generatio
n and formatting respectively.
 We will also use open-source libraries such as Flask to speed up the developmen
t.
 The mobile applications will be deployed on the main platforms currently
 available (iOS, Android, Windows Phone) and will be written accordingly
 to each devices' programming language.
 Client-server communication will be platform agnostic since it will happen
 through an encrypted RESTful API which returns its data through JSON.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Domain Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suppose these conditions will be respected at any given time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user will request help only if he/she needs it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user will never try to exploit the system's features (e.g.
 sleep in the car);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user will never fake his/her position to cause a denial of service;
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user will only provide correct and authentic information while signing
 up - a booked car will always be driven by the user who reserved it;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user will never be robbed of the access credentials and the verification
 code;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the user agrees to be geolocalized;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each available car is fully functional;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each car has an embedded key to turn on the engine;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each car is equipped with a properly working ADS and an ECS;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section explores some of the vague concepts or loosely explained ones:
 further hypotheses have been added to expand the description of the requirement
s and to account better for the interaction between the external environment
 and the developed application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to some unclear points in the specification we made some assumptions,
 which are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the system allows users to locate any car in PowerEnjoy's area of operation;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the system's money saving option has to be enabled or disabled in the user
 profile;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the system permits users to reserve an available car only in his/her city;
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
"a certain geographical region" means that the user can reach the vehicle
 in less than one hour from his position by foot or through public transportatio
n: by these means, we set a maximum radius of 15 km;
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the system can locate its users through Cellular Data or GPS; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the system's proximity check is done through one of these: numerical code
 on each cars' windshield or GPS data from user's phone;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the fees are applied as soon as one of these conditions is met: one minute
 is elapsed from the car's doors opening, or the engine is revved;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each seat is equipped with a sensor which is used to detect the number of
 passengers into each car;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each user can't reserve more than one car at the same time;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
to be eligible for the 10% discount, almost two passengers have to remain
 seated at the same time for at least one minute;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if a car is parked in a special area, the discount equals to 40%;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Section
Specific Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 requirements that the system developed has to satisfy, when the domain
 properties previously denoted hold and referring to the declared goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Functional requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functional requirements include the functionalities that the system
 must necessarily have and describe the interactions between the system
 developed and the external environment independently from the implementation.

\begin_layout Subsection
Non-functional requirements 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The non-functional requirements are those not related to the functionality,
 but rather consider the quality of the system to be implemented (Quality
 of Service, QoS), regardless of the application domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Security:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each user will only be able to access functionality that competes to his
 category, and it is, therefore, necessary to provide an authentication
 method: it will be used the symmetric username/password one.
 Furthermore, each credential will not be stored in cleartext, and client/server
 communications will be protected by asymmetric encryption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Portability: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The client must be compatible with all hardware and software platforms to
 reach as many users as possible.
 This requirement is satisfied by realizing the client as a web application,
 in this way the only assumptions that must be met by users are the availability
 of a web browser and a connection to the Internet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stability and reliability: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The system must notify the user the result of each his/her transaction request
 while maintaining an optimal level of reliability.
 Therefore it will be able to face with the possible loss of connection
 between clients and the central server by ensuring atomicity of all operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Performance: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As for performance, the timing of getting and insertion the information
 in the database must be acceptable to do not block the whole system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concurrency management: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The system must ensure data consistency while dealing with multiple concurrent
 accesses to the same resource in the database by multiple users authenticated
 to the system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The system has to include several graphical user interfaces: intuitive,
 complete and exceptionally easy to use.
 An interface to contain areas of input, dialog boxes, buttons, links and
 drop-down menus will be developed.
 The interfaces will interact with business logic and then be differentiated
 according to user roles in the system: each interface will provide access
 to features that compete for the particular user who is logged in.

Scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will present some possible situations that may occur from the
 interaction between a user and the system developed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Alice is curious about PowerEnjoy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lily tells Alice about a new service called PowerEnjoy: Alice, now curious,
 tries to register to PowerEnjoy.
 She visits the homepage, browses the site a little and then proceeds to
 the registration page.
 Alice then enters all the data needed by the system to complete the process:
 name and surname, username, email address, password, ID card number and
 license number.
 To complete the sign-up she finally enters the billing information.
 Once everything is done, the system sends her a confirmation mail with
 a link used to activate her new account.
 She has now completed the registration, and she can log into the system
 and power enjoy the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grandpa Peter and his expired license
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grandpa Peter has been registered to PowerEnjoy for a quite long time.
 He loves the car sharing model, now more than ever since his old Panda
 broke a long time ago and he could not pick up his nephews, David and Goliath,
 from the pool.
 There is a problem, though: Peter is getting old, and his license has to
 be renewed to drive again.
 After a long day at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Grandpa Peter
 successfully got his shiny license back! To reactivate his PowerEnjoy account,
 Peter has to edit his account data and insert the new license card number:
 after having logged in, he proceeds to his personal area by clicking “Edit
 Personal Data", he puts the new data in the system, and finally he saves
 the changes.
 Grandpa Peter is on the road, again!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grandpa Peter and his nephews
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's rainy outside, so Grandpa Peter has to pick up his two nephews from
 the pool: he picks up his smartphone and checks if there are any available
 cars near him.
 He is getting old so he cannot walk for a long time, so he reserves the
 nearest car which, unfortunately, has less than 50% battery charge remaining.
 Once in the car's reach, Peter taps on “Open Vehicle” and inputs his verificati
on code.
 His memory is aging just like him so the usual “1969” code, which corresponds
 to the year he married his beloved Franca, turned into “1967” which is
 not accepted by the system.
 The system prompts him again, and this time Peter does not fail: the doors
 unlock, and Grandpa is on the road once more! Peter's driving skills are
 still amazing: he picks up the kids and gets home in no time, so he ends
 the rent.
 Unfortunately, he is not able to use the 20% discount due to the battery
 charge left, but he will be cut 10% since he took at least two other people
 in the car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pablo and Tata go to the cinema
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tata and Pablo make a great couple.
 It's Friday night, and the theaters are flooded by the latest sci-fi movie
 everyone love.
 Pablo loves all those lightsabers and starships while Tata just can't get
 the point out of them.
 The film will start in more than one hour: Pablo is ready for the night
 out, Tata has to fix her makeup.
 “Five minutes and I am ready!" - she said.
 Unfortunately, Pablo forgot to charge his phone so he can't use his phone's
 GPS to save precious battery juice and reserves his PowerEnjoy car by entering
 his address into the app.
 Time goes by; one hour has passed, and Pablo is still waiting for Tata
 who seems to have no intentions leaving the bathroom.
 The film has just begun, the reservation expired, the car is available
 to be reserved again, and Pablo has to pay 1€ fee: “One minute and we are
 rolling!” - she said.
 Pablo, may the force be with you! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gustavo, the discount hunter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gustavo is a saver, methodic and old-fashioned man, and he built an economic
 empire from scratch.
 He owns a vintage 1968 Ford Torino which is only used on Saturday afternoons
 with his closest friend to honor the times long gone: on the other days,
 he mainly uses PowerEnjoy.
 Gustavo has turned on the money saving option while signing up, and he
 loves it.
 Once in the car, he logs in and proceed to set up his seat and insert his
 destination: the system now calculates the overall cars distribution in
 the city, verifies the availability of power plugs in the nearest power
 grid stations to the arrival and suggests to park in a special area just
 300 meters away from his destination.
 Once there, Gustavo, just before ending the rental, takes care of plugging
 the car into the power grid: now, the smartphone application shows him
 the total cost which includes the 40% discount.

\begin_layout Section
Models 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we are going to abstract from the previously seen scenarios
 in order to have a more high-level description.
 For this purpose we will use UML (Uniﬁed Modeling Language) diagrams.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Use cases model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From previously denoted scenarios and from the whole analysis we did in
 this document, we individuated the use cases of the system to be developed.
 In these pictures there are some use Cases diagram which represent actors,
 their use cases and their interactions.
 Then some of them are better explained using a less formal and more narrative
 way.

Alloy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we tried to verify the consistency of our class diagram.
 To this goal, we realized a formal model of the system based both on the
 class diagram and in the previously done assumptions and considerations
 about constraints.
 We realized this model using Alloy sintax, thanks to which we get on formally
 describing the domain of our application and its properties.
 Then we veriﬁed the consistency of our model using Alloy Analizer.
 Here there is the code of the model of the system.
